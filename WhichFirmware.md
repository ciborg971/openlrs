# Which firmware? #

You will by now have probably noticed that there are quite a few different versions of the firmware.  Each of these variations to the core firmware has been created to meet specific requirements by the projects developers.

Each firmware is named with a variety of suffixes to help you identify what the firmware does.


Your choice of firmware will very much depend on your requirements.  Typically, most people start on just default, then over time would move on to other options as they make changes to there gear!
